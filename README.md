I'm just an old dude trying to learn new programming skills. Probably the most interesting thing about me is I'm a 1350 hour Private pilot. I fly a plane you never heard of. It's a Bellanca Super Viking, and it's hot - low wing, retractable landing gear, 300 horsepower engine, and cruises at 214 mph. That's faster than a lot of light twins. Love to FLY!
